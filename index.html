<br>Hi, I am Mohammad Abdi, a 3rd-year PhD candidate at Northeastern University. I received my B.S. degree from <a href="https://shirazu.ac.ir/en/home">Shiraz University (Pahlavi)</a> 
in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the highest honors, and my concentration was in Control, Optimization, and Signal Processing. 
In 2016, I started my M.S. program in Telecommunications Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Abbas Sheikhi and Prof. Mahmoud Farhang, 
working on the analysis, design, and development of Doppler-shifted interference signal cancellation algorithms using adaptive filters. 
In my master's thesis, I investigated novel solutions for dynamic and moving clutter rejection in passive radar systems. 
After obtaining my master's degree, I spent several years in industry where my experience includes working as an embedded system designer at <a href="https://en.bmn.ir">National Elites Foundation</a> and 
as a senior developer at <a href="http://www.isrc.ac.ir">Iranian Space Research Center</a>.
<br><br>I am currently a graduate research assistant in <a href="https://mentislab.info">MENTIS Laboratory</a>, advised by Prof. Francesco Restuccia. 
I am also a member of the <a href="https://wiot.northeastern.edu">Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT)</a>. 
My research interests include Embedded Systems, Wireless Communication Systems, and Artificial Intelligence. 
My current research focus is on Efficient AI enabling the deployment of ML models on resource-constrained IoT devices using acceleration and hardware-aware techniques, 
Edge Computing where devices collaboratively execute a distributed task, and utilizing dynamic neural networks to cope with mobile communication environments.
